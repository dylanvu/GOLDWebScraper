# what's next? Ideas for development?
    # figure out how to generalize accessing the path to the template file? make it more user friendly, somehow. May be able to only be done after converting to a .exe
    # figure out how to sort and format through all of this data as there will be a lot of it
        # may be a task for excel and VBA? Inject VBA code and run it using PyWin32?
            # Automate the creation of charts for each class?
            # Create new worksheets per department with the classes on the left, times on the top?
    # repeat the webscraper every hour between a specified time frame
        # Figure out how to update an existing Excel document
    # Optimize the single course scrape algorithim?
    # get rid of the .env file, instead integrate gold username and password directly into Excel sheet?
    # export into a .exe file?
        # eventually create a simple GUI, where you can input special template excel file and set a time range to scrape. Have that run in the background and be easily cancelled at any time?
